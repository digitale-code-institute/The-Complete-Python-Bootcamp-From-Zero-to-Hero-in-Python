<p>Hi&nbsp;Everyone,</p><p>Just a quick update on the Pylint library. To see the same report that I do in the video, in the newest version of PyLint you need to add -r y (report yes) at the end of the command, so the full command should be:</p><p><strong>pylint myexample.py -r y</strong></p><p>If you check out the video I only wrote <strong>pylint myexample.py</strong> , you will need to add on <strong>-r y</strong></p><p>Check out the previously answered QA Forum posts if you get stuck on this, thanks!</p><p>Jose</p>
